# IOT-Based Bed Vacancy Detection in Hospital
# Abstract - 
An efficient bed availability 
tracking system is necessary. In India, the 
availability of beds in hospitals is a big 
problem. Many times, people face issues 
related to the availability of many things. 
Whether it pertains to sleeping arrangements, 
seating options, or any other type of physical 
location, this has been perceived as a challenge
by our team. This project aims to develop a 
system using IoT and the Web. That would be 
able to detect the availability of beds. It will not 
only be beneficial for the person who is looking
for a bed but also for the hospital
administration to manage and distribute it in a
well-mannered way. The condition of bed
availability in India is very poor. People look
for treatment for many days. This situation in 
rural areas has even worsened, where many
people die due to a lack of proper treatment 
and ignorance by the hospital. If they can book 
a bed from their place in advance, then it will 
be best for people and hospitals. And this is also
beneficial for hospitals, as they can extend the
beds for emergencies. We completed this project 
with the help of a sensor (an IR sensor) to detect 
the presence of a person, Arduino as the heart of 
the system, and different kinds of IoT devices.
Plagiarism report is not attached, since the research
paper is already published.
